# MIS-Project 🚀  
**Maximum Independent Set Problem Analysis and Implementation**  

Welcome to the MIS-Project repository! This project focuses on analyzing and implementing solutions for the **Maximum Independent Set (MIS) Problem**, a classic NP-complete problem in graph theory. The repository includes both a **brute-force** and a **heuristic algorithm** to solve the MIS problem, along with comprehensive experimental analysis.

## 📜 Problem Description  
The **Maximum Independent Set Problem (MIS)** involves finding the largest set of mutually non-adjacent vertices in a given graph. This project addresses both the **decision problem** and the **optimization problem** for MIS using two different algorithms:  
1. **Brute-Force Algorithm:** Guarantees an optimal solution by exploring all possible subsets.  
2. **Heuristic Algorithm:** Provides a near-optimal solution with improved computational efficiency.  

### 🌍 Real-World Applications  
- **Communication Systems:** Minimizing interference by selecting non-adjacent network nodes.  
- **Task Scheduling:** Scheduling non-overlapping tasks.  
- **Social Networks:** Identifying non-connected groups in social networks.  

---

## 🚀 Features  
- **Brute-force algorithm** with correctness and quality analysis.  
- **Heuristic algorithm** with performance testing and accuracy evaluation.  
- **Random instance generator** for testing on various graph sizes and densities.  
- **Graph visualizations** to illustrate algorithm outputs.  
- **Comparison of results** between brute-force and heuristic approaches.

## 📊 Performance Summary  
- The **brute-force algorithm** was tested on small graphs and provided exact solutions.  
- The **heuristic algorithm** achieved an **average accuracy of 96%**, with consistent results across varying graph sizes.  
- Extensive testing included **2,500 instances** of randomly generated graphs to validate performance and accuracy.
